# Inventory-Management-System
Database Management System to/for:
- We can forecast the sales and monitor stock
- to order new inventory.
- Customer details can be added.
- Invoice generation.
- keep a track of transactions received through different payment methods.


The project maintains three levels of users:-
- Billing Level
- Manager Level
- Owner Level


- The billing counter will only be able to change the quantity of any product, i.e. he or she can either generate an invoice for any sold product or a return note for any customer returns.

- The manager will have the access to modify the rates if there exist any dynamic price inventory.

- The  owner will have access to the final report, which will include sales made on any given day, total sales made on any given counter, and sales made by any given salesperson.
